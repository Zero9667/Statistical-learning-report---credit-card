## 📂 Directory Structure

In our working directory, we have organized the files as follows:

*   **Root**
    *   This is your project directory containing your `.Rproj` file.

*   **data**
    *   We store all our data in this directory.
    *   **`raw data`**: This subdirectory contains only raw data files. These files should be treated as **read only** and should not be changed in any way.
    *   **`processed data`**: If you need to process/clean/modify your data, do this in R (not MS Excel) as you can document (and justify) any changes made. Any processed data should be saved to a separate file and stored here.
    *   **`metadata`**: Information about data collection methods, details of data download, and any other useful metadata should be saved in a text document in this subdirectory.

*   **R**
    *   This is an optional directory where we save all of the custom R functions we’ve written for the current analysis. These can then be sourced into R using the `source()` function.

*   **Rmd**
    *   An optional directory where we save our R markdown documents.

*   **scripts**
    *   The main R scripts we have written for the current project are saved here.

*   **output**
    *   Outputs from our R scripts such as plots, HTML files, and data summaries are saved here. This helps us and our collaborators distinguish what files are outputs and which are source files.
